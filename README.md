# Country List

Test project for Photobooth Supply Co. by Keith Pickering

## About

This is a React app with a NodeJS Express backend, using React Router for separate pages. Countries are fetched from the REST Countries API. They can be clicked, which opens a second page that displays more detailed country info. Countries can also be searched and are sorted by the number of times they've been clicked in the current session.

## Setup

You can run the project locally like so:

1. Run `npm install` from the root directory. Modules for both the Node environment and the React environment will be installed.
2. Run `npm start` from the root directory to start the backend.
3. Run `npm start` from the `country-list-client` directory to start the React app.
4. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a>.
